# FlowLayout Example in Jetpack Compose

This project demonstrates how to use `FlowColumn` in Jetpack Compose to create a dynamic and responsive layout. The layout includes colored boxes with varying sizes that are arranged in a flow layout.

## Features
- **FlowColumn** Utilizes the `FlowColumn` composable to create a flexible, wrapping layout for elements.
- **Dynamic Item Properties:** The boxes are generated dynamically with random colors, widths, and heights.
- **Custom Layout Weighting:** Boxes within the layout can have different weights, allowing them to take up varying amounts of space in the layout.
- **Rounded Corners and Padding:** Each box is styled with rounded corners and padding for a modern, visually appealing layout.
