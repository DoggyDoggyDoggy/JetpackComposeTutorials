## Note

These projects are based on the content from the book Jetpack Compose 1.7 Essentials. I've slightly modified the projects, particularly in terms of updating the Gradle environment, so they can now be run on my local machine. If you encounter issues with the original versions of these projects, you may find my versions more compatible with your setup.
