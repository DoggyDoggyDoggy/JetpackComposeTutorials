# Cascade Layout Example in Jetpack Compose

This project demonstrates how to create a custom cascade-style layout in Jetpack Compose using the `Layout` composable. The `CascadeLayout` arranges items in a cascading manner with customizable spacing.

## Features
- **Cascade Layout:** Items are laid out in a cascading style, where each subsequent item is placed with a margin between the previous ones.
- **Customizable Spacing:** The spacing between items can be adjusted using the `spacing` parameter.
- **Multiple Box Elements:** The layout includes `Box` elements with different sizes and background colors to demonstrate the cascade effect.
